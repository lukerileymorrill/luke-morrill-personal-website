            When I joined my current company, my previous experience had been limited to small programs built during internships, with little exposure to API development. However, I quickly transitioned into a fast-paced, iterative cycle of API design and implementation.

            As a backend developer using Ruby on Rails, my primary responsibility was to design and deliver new features through APIs. I worked closely with frontend developers to ensure smooth integration and timely delivery of features to stakeholders. This required a strong focus on both technical execution and team collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, I developed both hard and soft skills essential to the role. I learned how to clearly communicate technical ideas and challenges with the teamâ€”whether during planning, delivering mock APIs, or iterating on feedback. At the same time, I became proficient at building APIs efficiently without compromising quality.

          <p>
            Beyond writing API endpoints, I also took responsibility for keeping our API documentation current, maintaining an admin interface for managing backend records, and addressing key security concerns. Through this experience, I gained a strong, practical understanding of designing and maintaining RESTful APIs in a real-world production environment.
