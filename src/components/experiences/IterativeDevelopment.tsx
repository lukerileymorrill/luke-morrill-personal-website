        I championed an iterative development approach, delivering features in small, manageable increments. This allowed for rapid feedback, continuous improvement, and timely delivery of value to users.<br /><br />
        <strong>Key Contributions:</strong>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-left text-lg text-white/90 my-6 mx-auto max-w-2xl">
          <li>Planned and executed development sprints with clear goals and deliverables.</li>
          <li>Gathered user feedback and incorporated it into future iterations.</li>
          <li>Maintained a prioritized backlog and ensured transparency with stakeholders.</li>
          <li>Facilitated regular retrospectives to identify and implement process improvements.</li>
          <li>Delivered new features and bug fixes on a consistent, predictable schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Impact:</strong> <br />
        This approach led to higher user satisfaction, reduced risk, and a more adaptable development process.
